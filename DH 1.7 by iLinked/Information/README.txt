### DiscordHaxx README ###

Your antivirus might block the executable, or other libraries used.
Do not be alarmed however, this is only something known as a false positive.
A false positive is the basic concept of when an antivirus blocks something thinking it's malicious, while it's really not.

If the program doesn't load, make sure your files and folders are ok.

It's completely up to you if you wanna use it or not.
But i can guarentee you that DiscordHaxx is in no way malicious towards it's users.
