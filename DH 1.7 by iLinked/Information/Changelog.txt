1.8 [STABLE] - 2019:

Additions:
The token grabber has been updated for the new Discord patch.
HTTPS support for proxies.
A new folder called "Settings" has been added, which just holds a few files.

Improvements/Optimizations:
Token checker has been optimized once again.
It's .NET version has also been changed to "4.6" because of it being the most common major version among Windows 10 machines.

Disclaimers:
Proxies are still quite inefficient, however, we are planning to make it support SOCKS proxies.
The token grabber is not 100% reliable, but it should work in about 96/100 cases.

1.8 [BETA] - 2019:

Improvements/Optimizations:
Paralyzation method has been improved on greatly. This can fx. me noticed in the "flooder" attack.
Please keep in mind however, that this update also makes proxy-support be incredible inefficient, which will hopefull be fixed in the stable release.
Token checker was improved on heavily (including bug fixes, and better checking).

Bug fixes:
""Get token info" not working with hidden tokens" bug has been fixed.
Various other minor bug fixes.

Removed:
Token grabber and "log into token" features were removed due to Discord's new update.
Useless junk resources (mostly images) have been removed, and so the executable should load sightly faster.

Disclaimers:
Using proxies in this version will likely cause the program to malfunction at some point or another.
There is still stuff that needs to be fixed, so don't expect a generally flawless program.
We are currently experiencing a bug where "color2" will auto set itself as white. To fix this, just go to settings, press "load" in the themes section, and load "DicordHaxx.dht"

In the next update:
We are currently working on a working token grabber, which will likely be in the next update.



1.7 [STABLE] - 2019:
A major change to the token grabber has been made: it now gets sent by a discord webhook.
The preview available when making a theme has been improved on heavily, to make it look more like the casual DiscordHaxx UI.
An option to add tokens not from a list, but just from text has been added.
The "recover" button has been removed from the "Tokens" tab.
Heavy optimizations towards DiscordHaxx Shield, to make it faster, and so therefor attacks can be started off much quicker.
The settings now use JSON, which is gonna make them a lot more stable.
Small changes to the directories.
Other minor UI changes.

1.7(.1) [BETA] - 2019:
The token grabber now no longer shows a console, but instead just runs completely in the background.
The token puller has been made easier to use, because it now shows a dialog at the start where the user can choose a path to the database file.
Small optimizations towards the attacks.

1.7 [BETA] - 2019:
Proxy support is now here, meaning that you can use proxies for the different attacks.
The token grabbing feature has been added.
You can now log into tokens, and view their information.
Partitions are now removed, because of them basically being useless.
Multiple bug fixes
Minor UI changes.
More coming in the stable/official release :).
Also special thanks to TestSubject1029 and Jenz for testing the beta version through.
